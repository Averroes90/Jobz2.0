## Style Guidelines:
- Start with "I want to work at [Company] because..."
- Be specific - reference their actual products, mission, or recent initiatives
- Show I understand their problem space and how my background is relevant
- Keep it authentic and direct, not corporate-speak or sycophantic
- 4-6 sentences, punchy
- No generic statements that could apply to any company
- If there's a specific product or initiative I could contribute to, mention it
- End with something forward-looking about what I'd want to build or contribute

## Things to Avoid:
- "I'm passionate about..." (overused)
- "Excited to join..." (empty)
- Long lists of company values I supposedly align with
- Anything that sounds like I'm just flattering them
