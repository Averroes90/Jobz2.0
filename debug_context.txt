I'll research Oatly to provide specific, actionable insights for a Director Corporate Development application. Let me start with understanding their current business and recent developments.**PRODUCTS_AND_USERS:**

Oatly operates in over 20 markets with a product portfolio that includes oat drinks, yogurt alternatives, ice cream, cooking cream, mayonnaise, custard, and spread. Their products are available in 60,000 retail stores, 32,200 coffee shops globally, including 11,000 coffee shops in China and 6,000+ US locations including Starbucks. The company's Barista Edition oat milk built early momentum by positioning itself as the preferred choice for specialty coffee shops and baristas.

**KNOWN_PROBLEMS_OR_GAPS:**
- UK advertising ban in 2022 following 109 consumer complaints about unsubstantiated environmental claims
- Supply chain vulnerabilities: customer sourcing changes expected to impact 2025 growth by 300 basis points
- Category-wide challenges: plant-based milk sales fell 7.2% in 2023, attributed to price hikes and consumer perceptions about high sugar content and unfamiliar ingredients
- Rising competition from affordable private label oat milk brands pressuring market share and pricing

**RECENT_ACTIVITY:**
Oatly is exploring a China business carveout worth ~$200M with JP Morgan as advisor, driven by uncertainties over the Chinese market and tariff risks. The company discontinued construction of a China manufacturing facility and closed its Singapore facility as part of an asset-light strategy.

**ROLE_CONTEXT:**
A Director Corporate Development role would likely focus on strategic partnerships, acquisitions, and market expansion initiatives. The China carveout discussions involve strategic players and private equity funds, with Chinese beverage maker Genki Forest among interested parties. Recent partnerships include expanding regenerative agriculture programs with suppliers like Grain Millers Canada.
