Research {company_name} for a job application to their {role_title} position.{job_context}

I need the following information:

1. **Company headquarters address** - Find the main office or headquarters address. Format as:
   - address_line1: Street address (e.g., "548 Market St,")
   - address_line2: City, State ZIP (e.g., "San Francisco, CA 94104")

2. **Company context for cover letter** - Research what makes this company unique:
   - What are their main products/services?
   - What is their mission or what problems do they solve?
   - Any recent news, launches, or initiatives?
   - What is their culture or values?
   - What would be compelling reasons someone would want to work there?

Return your findings in this exact format:

ADDRESS_LINE1: [street address with comma]
ADDRESS_LINE2: [city, state zip]

COMPANY_CONTEXT:
[Detailed notes about the company - 3-5 paragraphs of research findings that would help write a compelling "why I want to work here" paragraph]
