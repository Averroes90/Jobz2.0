The URL suggests the company name is \"Spotonproduct\", but this may be an ASCII-only slug that differs from the actual display name\n2. Look for the company name mentioned across multiple sources (headings, labels, links, description)\n3. Prioritize:\n   - Names that appear consistently across multiple sources\n   - Proper capitalization and special characters (prefer \"Zūm\" over \"Zum\" or \"Ridezum\")\n   - Names in navigation links to company homepage\n   - Names in form labels like \"Why do you want to work at [Company]?\"\n4. If multiple variations exist (e.g., \"Ridezum\" in URL vs \"Zūm\" on page), choose the properly formatted display name\n5. Return ONLY the company name with no additional text or explanation\n6.
